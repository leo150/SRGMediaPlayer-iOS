 *  already in the buffer
 *
 *  Simply install an instance somewhere onto your custom player interface and bind to either a media player controller
 *  or a segments controller (if you need to support segments). You can also bind two labels for displaying the time
 *  and the remaining time.
 *
 *  The slider can be customized as follows:
 *    - `borderColor`: Color of the small border around the non-elapsed time track (defaults to black)
 *    - `minimumTrackTintColor`: Elapsed time track color (defaults to white)
 *    - `maximumTrackTintColor`: Preloaded track color (defaults to black)
 *    - `thumbTintColor`: Thumb color (defaults to white)
