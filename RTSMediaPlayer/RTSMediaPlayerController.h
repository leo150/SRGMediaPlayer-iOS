/**
 *  `RTSMediaPlayerController` is inspired by the `MPMoviePlayerController` class.
 *
 *  A media player (of type `RTSMediaPlayerController`) manages the playback of a media from a file or a network stream.
 *  For maximum flexibility, you can incorporate a media playerâ€™s view into a view hierarchy owned by your app and have 
 *  it managed by an `RTSMediaPlayerController` instance. If you just need a standard player with a view looking just
 *  like the standard iOS media player, you should simply instantiate an `RTSMediaPlayerViewController` which will manage
 *  the view for you.
 *
 *  The media player controller posts several notifications, see RTSMediaPlayerConstants.h
 *
 *  Errors are handled through the `RTSMediaPlayerPlaybackDidFailNotification` notification. There are two possible
 *  source of errors: either the error comes from the dataSource (see `RTSMediaPlayerControllerDataSource`) or from
 *  the network (playback error).
 *
 *  The media player controller manages its overlays visibility. See the `overlayViews` property.
 *
 *  Methods related to playback can be found in the `RTSMediaPlayback` protocol
